recording the videos at the same time as tracking them leads to really poor frame rates

the solution:
-- use ffmpeg to record the videos. it's faster and ligher than using opencv and python
-- after the videos have been recorded for a while, call the realTimeTracking script on the ffmpeg video as it records
